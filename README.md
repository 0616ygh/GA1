# GA1
In this contest, we  utilize generative AI such as chatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot, or similar tools to design a chipIgnite project targeted to an open-source hardware accelerator designed specifically for Keyword Spotting (KWS) applications.

we named our chip "GA1", Generatived Accelerator 1.

Our methodology is based on the CyberRio, the 2nd place in the 1st efabless AI-generated design contest. In addition, we have also completed chip hardening in several projects supported by Effables (OpenMPW7, 2209Q, 2306Q)

We will release all the code and prompts by the end of April.
